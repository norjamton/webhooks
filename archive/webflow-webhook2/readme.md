# Webflow Webhook - Second Attempt

## Overview
This project attempted to create an automated workflow that:
1. Listens for Webflow site publication events
2. Downloads the updated site content
3. Syncs with GitHub
4. Deploys to Firebase

## Implementation Details
- Used Express.js for webhook endpoint
- Attempted integration with Zapier for automation
- Explored Google Cloud Functions for serverless deployment

## Current Status
Project currently on hold due to challenges with:
- Webhook authentication
- Cloud function deployment
- Zapier integration limitations

## Future Improvements
- Implement proper authentication
- Add GitHub API integration
- Set up Firebase deployment automation
